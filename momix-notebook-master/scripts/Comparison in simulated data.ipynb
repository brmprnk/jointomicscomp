    "We first define the function that produces the simulated datasets. The function simulates 3-omics datasets (mRNA expression, methylation and protein quantification), using the CRAN InserSIM package. Each dataset is composed of 100 samples. We considered different scenarios. First, 'equally spaced' clusters (i.e., composed of the same number of samples) and heterogeneous clusters (i.e., composed of a variable number of samples) can be generated. Second, different numbers of clusters are imposed on the data: 5,10,15. "

However, the jDRs having best performances remain the same despite such variations. For the clustering methods sometimes small variability in intNMF results is observed.   "
